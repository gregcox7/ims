1.  **Cats on YouTube** Suppose you want to estimate the percentage of
    videos on YouTube that are cat videos. It is impossible for you to
    watch all videos on YouTube so you use a random video picker to
    select 1000 videos for you. You find that 2% of these videos are cat
    videos.Determine which of the following is an observation, a
    variable, a sample statistic (value calculated based on the observed
    sample), or a population parameter.

    1.  Percentage of all videos on YouTube that are cat videos.

    2.  2%.

    3.  A video in your sample.

    4.  Whether or not a video is a cat video.

1.  **Evaluate sampling methods** A university wants to determine what
    fraction of its undergraduate student body support a new \$25 annual
    fee to improve the student union. For each proposed method below,
    indicate whether the method is reasonable or not.

    1.  Survey a simple random sample of 500 students.

    2.  Stratify students by their field of study, then sample 10% of
        students from each stratum.

    3.  Cluster students by their ages (e.g. 18 years old in one
        cluster, 19 years old in one cluster, etc.), then randomly
        sample three clusters and survey all students in those clusters.

1.  **Family size** Suppose we want to estimate household size, where a
    "household\" is defined as people living together in the same
    dwelling, and sharing living accommodations. If we select students
    at random at an elementary school and ask them what their family
    size is, will this be a good measure of household size? Or will our
    average be biased? If so, will it overestimate or underestimate the
    true value?

1.  **Housing proposal across dorms** On a large college campus
    first-year students and sophomores live in dorms located on the
    eastern part of the campus and juniors and seniors live in dorms
    located on the western part of the campus. Suppose you want to
    collect student opinions on a new housing structure the college
    administration is proposing and you want to make sure your survey
    equally represents opinions from students from all years.

    1.  What type of study is this?

    2.  Suggest a sampling strategy for carrying out this study.

1.  **Internet use and life expectancy** The following scatterplot was
    created as part of a study evaluating the relationship between
    estimated life expectancy at birth (as of 2014) and percentage of
    internet users (as of 2009) in 208 countries for which such data
    were available. [@data:ciaFactbook]

    1.  Describe the relationship between life expectancy and percentage
        of internet users.

    2.  What type of study is this?

    3.  State a possible confounding variable that might explain this
        relationship and describe its potential effect.

1.  **Random digit dialing** The Gallup Poll uses a procedure called
    random digit dialing, which creates phone numbers based on a list of
    all area codes in America in conjunction with the associated number
    of residential households in each area code. Give a possible reason
    the Gallup Poll chooses to use random digit dialing instead of
    picking phone numbers from the phone book.

1.  **Reading the paper** Below are excerpts from two articles published
    in the *NY Times*:

    1.  An article titled *Risks: Smokers Found More Prone to Dementia*
        states the following: [@news:smokingDementia]

        1em1em "Researchers analyzed data from 23,123 health plan
        members who participated in a voluntary exam and health behavior
        survey from 1978 to 1985, when they were 50-60 years old. 23
        years later, about 25% of the group had dementia, including
        1,136 with Alzheimer's disease and 416 with vascular dementia.
        After adjusting for other factors, the researchers concluded
        that pack-a-day smokers were 37% more likely than nonsmokers to
        develop dementia, and the risks went up with increased smoking;
        44% for one to two packs a day; and twice the risk for more than
        two packs.\"

        Based on this study, can we conclude that smoking causes
        dementia later in life? Explain your reasoning.

    2.  Another article titled *The School Bully Is Sleepy* states the
        following: [@news:bullySleep]

        1em1em "The University of Michigan study, collected survey data
        from parents on each child's sleep habits and asked both parents
        and teachers to assess behavioral concerns. About a third of the
        students studied were identified by parents or teachers as
        having problems with disruptive behavior or bullying. The
        researchers found that children who had behavioral issues and
        those who were identified as bullies were twice as likely to
        have shown symptoms of sleep disorders.\"

        A friend of yours who read the article says, "The study shows
        that sleep disorders lead to bullying in school children.\" Is
        this statement justified? If not, how best can you describe the
        conclusion that can be drawn from this study?

1.  **Relaxing after work** The General Social Survey asked the
    question, "After an average work day, about how many hours do you
    have to relax or pursue activities that you enjoy?\" to a random
    sample of 1,155 Americans. The average relaxing time was found to be
    1.65 hours. Determine which of the following is an observation, a
    variable, a sample statistic (value calculated based on the observed
    sample), or a population parameter.

    1.  An American in the sample.

    2.  Number of hours spent relaxing after an average work day.

    3.  1.65.

    4.  Average number of hours all Americans spend relaxing after an
        average work day.

1.  **Sampling strategies** A statistics student who is curious about
    the relationship between the amount of time students spend on social
    networking sites and their performance at school decides to conduct
    a survey. Various research strategies for collecting data are
    described below. In each, name the sampling method proposed and any
    bias you might expect.

    1.  He randomly samples 40 students from the study's population,
        gives them the survey, asks them to fill it out and bring it
        back the next day.

    2.  He gives out the survey only to his friends, making sure each
        one of them fills out the survey.

    3.  He posts a link to an online survey on Facebook and asks his
        friends to fill out the survey.

    4.  He randomly samples 5 classes and asks a random sample of
        students from those classes to fill out the survey.

1.  **Air pollution and birth outcomes, scope of inference**
    Exercise [\[study_components_airpoll\]](#study_components_airpoll){reference-type="ref"
    reference="study_components_airpoll"} introduces a study where
    researchers collected data to examine the relationship between air
    pollutants and preterm births in Southern California. During the
    study air pollution levels were measured by air quality monitoring
    stations. Length of gestation data were collected on 143,196 births
    between the years 1989 and 1993, and air pollution exposure during
    gestation was calculated for each birth.

    1.  Identify the population of interest and the sample in this
        study.

    2.  Comment on whether or not the results of the study can be
        generalized to the population, and if the findings of the study
        can be used to establish causal relationships.

1.  **Buteyko method, scope of inference**
    Exercise [\[study_components_buteyko\]](#study_components_buteyko){reference-type="ref"
    reference="study_components_buteyko"} introduces a study on using
    the Buteyko shallow breathing technique to reduce asthma symptoms
    and improve quality of life. As part of this study 600 asthma
    patients aged 18-69 who relied on medication for asthma treatment
    were recruited and randomly assigned to two groups: one practiced
    the Buteyko method and the other did not. Those in the Buteyko group
    experienced, on average, a significant reduction in asthma symptoms
    and an improvement in quality of life.

    1.  Identify the population of interest and the sample in this
        study.

    2.  Comment on whether or not the results of the study can be
        generalized to the population, and if the findings of the study
        can be used to establish causal relationships.

1.  **Cheaters, scope of inference**
    Exercise [\[study_components_cheaters\]](#study_components_cheaters){reference-type="ref"
    reference="study_components_cheaters"} introduces a study where
    researchers studying the relationship between honesty, age, and
    self-control conducted an experiment on 160 children between the
    ages of 5 and 15. The researchers asked each child to toss a fair
    coin in private and to record the outcome (white or black) on a
    paper sheet, and said they would only reward children who report
    white. Half the students were explicitly told not to cheat and the
    others were not given any explicit instructions. Differences were
    observed in the cheating rates in the instruction and no instruction
    groups, as well as some differences across children's
    characteristics within each group.

    1.  Identify the population of interest and the sample in this
        study.

    2.  Comment on whether or not the results of the study can be
        generalized to the population, and if the findings of the study
        can be used to establish causal relationships.

1.  **Haters are gonna hate, study confirms** A study published in the
    *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology* asked a group of 200
    randomly sampled men and women to evaluate how they felt about
    various subjects, such as camping, health care, architecture,
    taxidermy, crossword puzzles, and Japan in order to measure their
    attitude towards mostly independent stimuli. Then, they presented
    the participants with information about a new product: a microwave
    oven. This microwave oven does not exist, but the participants
    didn't know this, and were given three positive and three negative
    fake reviews. People who reacted positively to the subjects on the
    dispositional attitude measurement also tended to react positively
    to the microwave oven, and those who reacted negatively tended to
    react negatively to it. Researchers concluded that "some people tend
    to like things, whereas others tend to dislike things, and a more
    thorough understanding of this tendency will lead to a more thorough
    understanding of the psychology of attitudes.\" [@Hepler:2013]

1.  **Stealers, scope of inference**
    Exercise [\[study_components_stealers\]](#study_components_stealers){reference-type="ref"
    reference="study_components_stealers"} introduces a study on the
    relationship between socio-economic class and unethical behavior. As
    part of this study 129 University of California Berkeley
    undergraduates were asked to identify themselves as having low or
    high social-class by comparing themselves to others with the most
    (least) money, most (least) education, and most (least) respected
    jobs. They were also presented with a jar of individually wrapped
    candies and informed that the candies were for children in a nearby
    laboratory, but that they could take some if they wanted. After
    completing some unrelated tasks, participants reported the number of
    candies they had taken. It was found that those who were identified
    as upper-class took more candy than others.

1.  **Stressed out, Part I** A study that surveyed a random sample of
    otherwise healthy high school students found that they are more
    likely to get muscle cramps when they are stressed. The study also
    noted that students drink more coffee and sleep less when they are
    stressed.
