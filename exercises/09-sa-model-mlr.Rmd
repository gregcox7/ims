1.  (a) $\widehat{baby\_\hspace{0.3mm}weight} = 123.05 - 8.94 \times smoke$
    (b) The estimated body weight of babies born to smoking mothers is
    8.94 ounces lower than babies born to non-smoking mothers. Smoker:
    $123.05 - 8.94 \times 1 = 114.11$ ounces. Non-smoker:
    $123.05 - 8.94 \times 0 = 123.05$ ounces. (c) $H_0$: $\beta_1 = 0$.
    $H_A$: $\beta_1 \ne 0$. $T= -8.65$, and the p-value is
    approximately 0. Since the p-value is very small, we reject $H_0$.
    The data provide strong evidence that the true slope parameter is
    different than 0 and that there is an association between birth
    weight and smoking. Furthermore, having rejected $H_0$, we can
    conclude that smoking is associated with lower birth weights.

1.  (a) $\widehat{baby\_weight} = -80.41 + 0.44 \times gestation 
    + 3.33 \times parity - 0.01 \times age + 1.15 \times height 
    + 0.05 \times weight - 8.40 \times smoke$. (b) $\beta_{gestation}$:
    The model predicts a 0.44 ounce increase in the birth weight of the
    baby for each additional day of pregnancy, all else held constant.
    $\beta_{age}$: The model predicts a 0.01 ounce decrease in the birth
    weight of the baby for each additional year in mother's age, all
    else held constant. (c) Parity might be correlated with one of the
    other variables in the model, which complicates model estimation.
    (d) $\widehat{baby\_\hspace{0.3mm}weight} = 120.58$.
    $e = 120 - 120.58 = -0.58$. The model over-predicts this baby's
    birth weight. (e) $R^2 = 0.2504$. $R_{adj}^2 = 0.2468$.

1.  (a) (-0.32, 0.16). We are 95% confident that male students on
    average have GPAs 0.32 points lower to 0.16 points higher than
    females when controlling for the other variables in the model.
    (b) Yes, since the p-value is larger than 0.05 in all cases (not
    including the intercept).

1.  Remove age.

1.  Based on the p-value alone, either gestation or smoke should be
    added to the model first. However, since the adjusted $R^2$ for the
    model with gestation is higher, it would be preferable to add
    gestation in the first step of the forward- selection algorithm.
    (Other explanations are possible. For instance, it would be
    reasonable to only use the adjusted $R^2$.)

1.  (a) There are a few potential outliers, e.g. on the left in the
    variable, but nothing that will be of serious concern in a data set
    this large. (b) When coefficient estimates are sensitive to which
    variables are included in the model, this typically indicates that
    some variables are collinear. For example, a possum's gender may be
    related to its head length, which would explain why the coefficient
    (and p-value) for changed when we removed the variable. Likewise, a
    possum's skull width is likely to be related to its head length,
    probably even much more closely related than the head length was to
    gender.

1.  (a) The logistic model relating $\hat{p}_i$ to the predictors may be
    written as $\log\left( \frac{\hat{p}_i}{1 - \hat{p}_i} \right) 
    = 33.5095 - 1.4207\times sex\_male_i - 0.2787 \times skull\_width_i 
    + 0.5687 \times total\_length_i - 1.8057 \times tail\_length_i$.
    Only has a positive association with a possum being from Victoria.
    (b) $\hat{p} = 0.0062$. While the probability is very near zero, we
    have not run diagnostics on the model. We might also be a little
    skeptical that the model will remain accurate for a possum found in
    a US zoo. For example, perhaps the zoo selected a possum with
    specific characteristics but only looked in one region. On the other
    hand, it is encouraging that the possum was caught in the wild.
    (Answers regarding the reliability of the model probability will
    vary.)

1.  (a) False. When predictors are collinear, it means they are
    correlated, and the inclusion of one variable can have a substantial
    influence on the point estimate (and standard error) of another.
    (b) True. (c) False. This would only be the case if the data was
    from an experiment and $x_1$ was one of the variables set by the
    researchers. (Multiple regression can be useful for forming
    hypotheses about causal relationships, but it offers zero
    guarantees.) (d) False. We should check normality like we would for
    inference for a single mean: we look for particularly extreme
    outliers if $n \geq 30$ or for clear outliers if $n < 30$.
