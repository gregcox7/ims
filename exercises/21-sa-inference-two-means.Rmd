1. \(a) $\mu_{\bar{x}_1} = 15$, $\sigma_{\bar{x}_1} = 20 / \sqrt{50} = 2.8284.$ (b) $\mu_{\bar{x}_2} = 20$, $\sigma_{\bar{x}_1} = 10 / \sqrt{30} = 1.8257.$ (c) $\mu_{\bar{x}_2 - \bar{x}_1} = 20 - 15 = 5$, $\sigma_{\bar{x}_2 - \bar{x}_1} = \sqrt{\left(20 / \sqrt{50}\right)^2 + \left(10 / \sqrt{30}\right)^2} = 3.3665.$ (d) Think of $\bar{x}_1$ and $\bar{x}_2$ as being random variables, and we are considering the standard deviation of the difference of these two random variables, so we square each standard deviation, add them together, and then take the square root of the sum: $SD_{\bar{x}_2 - \bar{x}_1} = \sqrt{SD_{\bar{x}_2}^2 + SD_{\bar{x}_1}^2}.$

1. \(a) Chicken fed linseed weighed an average of 218.75 grams while those fed horsebean weighed an average of 160.20 grams. Both distributions are relatively symmetric with no apparent outliers. There is more variability in the weights of chicken fed linseed. (b) $H_0: \mu_{ls} = \mu_{hb}$. $H_A: \mu_{ls} \ne \mu_{hb}$. We leave the conditions to you to consider. $T=3.02$, $df = min(11, 9) = 9$ $\to$ p-value $= 0.014$. Since p-value $<$ 0.05, reject $H_0$. The data provide strong evidence that there is a significant difference between the average weights of chickens that were fed linseed and horsebean. (c) Type 1 Error, since we rejected $H_0$. (d) Yes, since p-value $>$ 0.01, we would not have rejected $H_0$.

1. $H_0: \mu_C = \mu_S$. $H_A: \mu_C \ne \mu_S$. $T = 3.27$, $df=11$ $\to$ p-value $= 0.007$. Since p-value $< 0.05$, reject $H_0$. The data provide strong evidence that the average weight of chickens that were fed casein is different than the average weight of chickens that were fed soybean (with weights from casein being higher). Since this is a randomized experiment, the observed difference can be attributed to the diet.

1. $H_0: \mu_{T} = \mu_{C}$. $H_A: \mu_{T} \ne \mu_{C}$. $T=2.24$, $df=21$ $\to$ p-value $= 0.036$. Since p-value $<$ 0.05, reject $H_0$. The data provide strong evidence that the average food consumption by the patients in the treatment and control groups are different. Furthermore, the data indicate patients in the distracted eating (treatment) group consume more food than patients in the control group.

1. $H_0: \mu_{T} = \mu_{C}$ and $H_A: \mu_{T} \ne \mu_{C}$. We are told to assume that conditions for inference are satisfied. $T_{21} = 2.21$, 0.02 $<$ p-value $<$ 0.05. Since p-value $<$ 0.05, we reject $H_0$. The data provide convincing evidence that the average numbers of food items recalled by the patients in the treatment and control groups are different.
