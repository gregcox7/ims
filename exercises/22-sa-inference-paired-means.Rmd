1. Paired, data are recorded in the same cities at two different time points. The temperature in a city at one point is not independent of the temperature in the same city at another time point

1. \(a) Since it's the same students at the beginning and the end of the semester, there is a pairing between the datasets, for a given student their beginning and end of semester grades are dependent. (b) Since the subjects were sampled randomly, each observation in the men's group does not have a special correspondence with exactly one observation in the other (women's) group. (c) Since it's the same subjects at the beginning and the end of the study, there is a pairing between the datasets, for a subject student their beginning and end of semester artery thickness are dependent. (d) Since it's the same subjects at the beginning and the end of the study, there is a pairing between the datasets, for a subject student their beginning and end of semester weights are dependent.

1. \(a) For each observation in one dataset, there is exactly one specially corresponding observation in the other dataset for the same geographic location. The data are paired. (b) $H_0: \mu_{\text{diff}} = 0$ (There is no difference in average number of days exceeding 90F in 1948 and 2018 for NOAA stations.) $H_A: \mu_{\text{diff}} \neq 0$ (There is a difference.) (c) Locations were randomly sampled, so independence is reasonable. The sample size is at least 30, so we're just looking for particularly extreme outliers: none are present (the observation off left in the histogram would be considered a clear outlier, but not a particularly extreme one). Therefore, the conditions are satisfied. (d) $SE = 17.2 / \sqrt{197} = 1.23$. $T = \frac{2.9 - 0}{1.23} = 2.36$ with degrees of freedom $df = 197 - 1 = 196$. This leads to a one-tail area of 0.0096 and a p-value of about 0.019. (e) Since the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject $H_0$. The data provide strong evidence that NOAA stations observed more 90F days in 2018 than in 1948. (f) Type 1 Error, since we may have incorrectly rejected $H_0$. This error would mean that NOAA stations did not actually observe a decrease, but the sample we took just so happened to make it appear that this was the case. (g) No, since we rejected $H_0$, which had a null value of 0.

1. \(a) $SE = 1.23$ and $z^{\star} = 1.65$. $2.9 \pm 1.65 \times 1.23 \to (0.87, 4.93)$. (b) We are 90% confident that there was an increase of 0.87 to 4.93 in the average number of days that hit 90F in 2018 relative to 1948 for NOAA stations. (c) Yes, since the interval lies entirely above 0.
