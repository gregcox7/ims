1.  **Baby weights and smoking.** 
The Child Health and Development Studies investigate a range of topics. One study considered all pregnancies between 1960 and 1967 among women in the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan in the San Francisco East Bay area. 
Here, we study the relationship between smoking and weight of the baby. 
The variable `smoke` is coded 1 if the mother is a smoker, and 0 if not. 
The summary table below shows the results of a linear regression model for predicting the average birth weight of babies, measured in ounces, based on the smoking status of the mother. [@data:babies]

                      Estimate   Std. Error   t value   Pr($>$$|$t$|$)
      ------------- ---------- ------------ --------- ----------------
        (Intercept)     123.05         0.65    189.60           0.0000
              smoke      -8.94         1.03     -8.65           0.0000

    The variability within the smokers and non-smokers are about equal
    and the distributions are symmetric. With these conditions
    satisfied, it is reasonable to apply the model. (Note that we don't
    need to check linearity since the predictor has only two levels.)

    1.  Write the equation of the regression model.

    2.  Interpret the slope in this context, and calculate the predicted
        birth weight of babies born to smoker and non-smoker mothers.

    3.  Is there a statistically significant relationship between the
        average birth weight and smoking?

1.  **Baby weights, Part II**
    Exercise [\[baby_weights_smoke\]](#baby_weights_smoke){reference-type="ref"
    reference="baby_weights_smoke"} introduces a dataset on birth
    weight of babies. Another variable we consider is `parity`, which is
    1 if the child is the first born, and 0 otherwise. The summary table
    below shows the results of a linear regression model for predicting
    the average birth weight of babies, measured in ounces, from
    `parity`.

             parity      -1.93         1.19     -1.62           0.1052

    1.  Write the equation of the regression model.

    2.  Interpret the slope in this context, and calculate the predicted
        birth weight of first borns and others.

    3.  Is there a statistically significant relationship between the
        average birth weight and parity?

1. **Baby weights, Part III** We considered the variables `smoke` and
    `parity`, one at a time, in modeling birth weights of babies in
    Exercises [\[baby_weights_smoke\]](#baby_weights_smoke){reference-type="ref"
    reference="baby_weights_smoke"}
    and [\[baby_weights_parity\]](#baby_weights_parity){reference-type="ref"
    reference="baby_weights_parity"}. A more realistic approach to
    modeling infant weights is to consider all possibly related
    variables at once. Other variables of interest include length of
    pregnancy in days (`gestation`), mother's age in years (`age`),
    mother's height in inches (`height`), and mother's pregnancy weight
    in pounds (`weight`). Below are three observations from this data
    set.

                    bwt      gestation    parity      age       height     weight     smoke

               2    113         282         0          33         64        135         0

    The summary table below shows the results of a regression model for
    predicting the average birth weight of babies based on all of the
    variables included in the dataset.

              smoke      -8.40         0.95     -8.81           0.0000

    1. Write the equation of the regression model that includes all of
        the variables.

    2.  Interpret the slopes of `gestation` and `age` in this context.

    3.  The coefficient for `parity` is different than in the linear
        model shown in
        Exercise [\[baby_weights_parity\]](#baby_weights_parity){reference-type="ref"
        reference="baby_weights_parity"}. Why might there be a
        difference?

    4.  Calculate the residual for the first observation in the data
        set.

    5.  The variance of the residuals is 249.28, and the variance of the
        birth weights of all babies in the dataset is 332.57. Calculate
        the $R^2$ and the adjusted $R^2$. Note that there are 1,236
        observations in the dataset.

1. **Palmer penguins, predicting body mass.**
Researchers studying a community of Antarctic penguins collected body measurement (bill length, bill depth, and flipper length measured in millimeters and body mass, measured in grams), species (*Adelie*, *Chinstrap*, or *Gentoo*), and sex (female or male) data on 344 penguins living on three islands (Torgersen, Biscoe, and Dream) in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.^[The [`penguins`](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/penguins.html) data used in this exercise can be found in the **palmerpenguins** R package.] The summary table below shows the results of a linear regression model for predicting body mass (which is more difficult to measure) from the other variables in the dataset. [@palmerpenguins] 
    
    ```{r}
    library(palmerpenguins)
    library(broom)
    library(kableExtra)
    library(tidyverse)
    
    m_full_penguins <- lm(body_mass_g ~ bill_length_mm + bill_depth_mm + flipper_length_mm + sex + species, data = penguins)
    
    m_full_penguins_rsq <- round(glance(m_full_penguins)$r.squared*100, 1)
    m_full_penguins_tidy <- tidy(m_full_penguins)
    
    m_full_penguins_tidy %>%
      mutate(
        p.value = ifelse(p.value < 0.0001, "<0.0001", round(p.value, 4)),
        ) %>%
      kbl(linesep = "", booktabs = TRUE, align = "lrrrr", digits = 1) %>%
      kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "condensed"), 
                    latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position"), 
                    full_width = FALSE) %>%
      column_spec(1:5, width = "5em")
    ```

    a.  Write the equation of the regression model.

    a.  Interpret each one of the slopes in this context.

    b.  Calculate the residual for a male Adelie penguin that weighs 3750 grams with the following body measurements: `bill_length_mm` = 39.1, `bill_depth_mm` = 18.7, `flipper_length_mm` = 181. Does the model overpredict or underpredict this penguin's weight?
    
    c.  The $R^2$ of this model is `r m_full_penguins_rsq`%. Interpret this value in context of the data and the model.

1. **GPA** A survey of 55 Duke University students asked about their
    GPA, number of hours they study at night, number of nights they go
    out, and their gender. Summary output of the regression model is
    shown below. Note that male is coded as 1.

    1. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the coefficient of
        gender in the model, and interpret it in the context of the
        data.

    2.  Would you expect a 95% confidence interval for the slope of the
        remaining variables to include 0? Explain

1.  **Cherry trees** Timber yield is approximately equal to the volume
    of a tree, however, this value is difficult to measure without first
    cutting the tree down. Instead, other variables, such as height and
    diameter, may be used to predict a tree's volume and yield.
    Researchers wanting to understand the relationship between these
    variables for black cherry trees collected data from 31 such trees
    in the Allegheny National Forest, Pennsylvania. Height is measured
    in feet, diameter in inches (at 54 inches above ground), and volume
    in cubic feet. [@Hand:1994]

                      Estimate   Std. Error   t value   Pr($>$$|$t$|$)
      ------------- ---------- ------------ --------- ----------------
        (Intercept)     -57.99         8.64     -6.71             0.00
             height       0.34         0.13      2.61             0.01
           diameter       4.71         0.26     17.82             0.00

    1.  Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the coefficient of
        height, and interpret it in the context of the data.

    2.  One tree in this sample is 79 feet tall, has a diameter of 11.3
        inches, and is 24.2 cubic feet in volume. Determine if the model
        overestimates or underestimates the volume of this tree, and by
        how much.

1.  **Multiple regression fact checking** Determine which of the
    following statements are true and false. For each statement that is
    false, explain why it is false.

    1.  If predictors are collinear, then removing one variable will
        have no influence on the point estimate of another variable's
        coefficient.

    2.  Suppose a numerical variable $x$ has a coefficient of
        $b_1 = 2.5$ in the multiple regression model. Suppose also that
        the first observation has $x_1 = 7.2$, the second observation
        has a value of $x_1 = 8.2$, and these two observations have the
        same values for all other predictors. Then the predicted value
        of the second observation will be 2.5 higher than the prediction
        of the first observation based on the multiple regression model.

    3.  If a regression model's first variable has a coefficient of
        $b_1 = 5.7$, then if we are able to influence the data so that
        an observation will have its $x_1$ be 1 larger than it would
        otherwise, the value $y_1$ for this observation would increase
        by 5.7.

    4.  Suppose we fit a multiple regression model based on a dataset
        of 472 observations. We also notice that the distribution of the
        residuals includes some skew but does not include any
        particularly extreme outliers. Because the residuals are not
        nearly normal, we should not use this model and require more
        advanced methods to model these data.

    Exercise [\[movie_returns_altogether\]](#movie_returns_altogether){reference-type="ref"
    reference="movie_returns_altogether"} analyzed return-on-investment
    (ROI) for movies based on release year and genre of movies. The
    plots below show the predicted ROI vs. actual ROI for each of the
    genres separately. Do these figures support the comment in the
    FiveThirtyEight.com article that states, "The return-on-investment
    potential for horror movies is absurd." Note that the x-axis range
    varies for each plot.

1.  **Baby weights, Part IV**
    Exercise [\[baby_weights_mlr\]](#baby_weights_mlr){reference-type="ref"
    reference="baby_weights_mlr"} considers a model that predicts a
    newborn's weight using several predictors (gestation length, parity,
    age of mother, height of mother, weight of mother, smoking status of
    mother). The table below shows the adjusted R-squared for the full
    model as well as adjusted R-squared values for all models we
    evaluate in the first step of the backwards elimination process.

          Model                 Adjusted $R^2$

        7 No smoking status             0.2072

    Which, if any, variable should be removed from the model first?

1. **Palmer penguins, backwards elimination.**
The following full model is built to predict the weights of three species (*Adelie*, *Chinstrap*, or *Gentoo*) of penguins living in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. [@palmerpenguins]

    ```{r}
    library(palmerpenguins)
    library(broom)
    library(kableExtra)
    library(tidyverse)
    
    m_full_penguins <- lm(body_mass_g ~ bill_length_mm + bill_depth_mm + flipper_length_mm + sex + species, data = penguins)
    
    m_full_penguins_rsq_adj <- round(glance(m_full_penguins)$adj.r.squared*100, 1)
    m_full_penguins_tidy <- tidy(m_full_penguins)
    
    m_full_penguins_tidy %>%
      mutate(
        p.value = ifelse(p.value < 0.0001, "<0.0001", round(p.value, 4)),
        ) %>%
      kbl(linesep = "", booktabs = TRUE, align = "lrrrr", digits = 1) %>%
      kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "condensed"), 
                    latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position"), 
                    full_width = FALSE) %>%
      column_spec(1:5, width = "5em")
    ```
    
    The adjusted $R^2$ of the full model is `r m_full_penguins_rsq_adj`%. In order to evaluate whether any of the predictors can be dropped from the model without losing predictive performance of the model, the researchers dropped one variable at a time, refit the model, and recorded the adjusted $R^2$ of the smaller model. These values are given below.
    
    ```{r}
    m_bl <- update(m_full_penguins, . ~ . - bill_length_mm, data = penguins) %>%
      glance() %>%
      pull(adj.r.squared) %>%
      round(3)
    m_bd <- update(m_full_penguins, . ~ . - bill_depth_mm, data = penguins) %>%

    ```
    
    -  Drop `bill_length_mm`:    `r m_bl*100`%
    -  Drop `bill_depth_mm`:     `r m_bd*100`%
    -  Drop `flipper_length_mm`: `r m_fl*100`%

1. **Palmer penguins, backwards elimination.**
Using body measurement and other relevant data on three species (*Adelie*, *Chinstrap*, or *Gentoo*) of penguins living in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica, we want to predict their body mass. In order to do so, we will evaluate five candidate predictors and make a decision about including them in the model using forward selection and adjusted $R^2$. Below are the five models we evaluate and their adjusted $R^2$ values:

    ```

    -  Add `bill_length_mm`:    `r m_bl*100`%
    -  Add `bill_depth_mm`:     `r m_bd*100`%
    -  Add `flipper_length_mm`: `r m_fl*100`%

1. **Movie lovers, Part II** Suppose an online media streaming company
    is interested in building a movie recommendation system. The website
    maintains data on the movies in their database (genre, length, cast,
    director, budget, etc.) and additionally collects data from their
    subscribers ( demographic information, previously watched movies,
    how they rated previously watched movies, etc.). The recommendation
    system will be deemed successful if subscribers actually watch, and
    rate highly, the movies recommended to them. Should the company use
    the adjusted $R^2$ or the p-value approach in selecting variables
    for their recommendation system?

1. **Possum classification, Part I** The common brushtail possum of the
    Australia region is a bit cuter than its distant cousin, the
    American opossum (see
    Figure [\[brushtail_possum\]](#brushtail_possum){reference-type="ref+page"
    reference="brushtail_possum"}). We consider 104 brushtail possums
    from two regions in Australia, where the possums may be considered a
    random sample from the population. The first region is Victoria,
    which is in the eastern half of Australia and traverses the southern
    coast. The second region consists of New South Wales and Queensland,
    which make up eastern and northeastern Australia. We use logistic
    regression to differentiate between possums in these two regions.
    The outcome variable, called , takes value 1 when a possum is from
    Victoria and 0 when it is from New South Wales or Queensland. We
    consider five predictors: (an indicator for a possum being male), ,
    , , and . Each variable is summarized in a histogram. The full
    logistic regression model and a reduced model after variable
    selection are summarized in the table.

      -------------- ---------- --------- ------- ---------------- -- ---------- -------- ------- ----------------

    1. Examine each of the predictors. Are there any outliers that are
        likely to have a very large influence on the logistic regression
        model?

    2.  The summary table for the full model indicates that at least one
        variable should be eliminated when using the p-value approach
        for variable selection: . The second component of the table
        summarizes the reduced model following variable selection.
        Explain why the remaining estimates change between the two
        models.

1. **Challenger disaster and model building.** On January 28, 1986, a routine
    launch was anticipated for the Challenger space shuttle.
    Seventy-three seconds into the flight, disaster happened: the
    shuttle broke apart, killing all seven crew members on board. An
    investigation into the cause of the disaster focused on a critical
    seal called an O-ring, and it is believed that damage to these
    O-rings during a shuttle launch may be related to the ambient
    temperature during the launch. The table below summarizes
    observational data on O-rings for 23 shuttle missions, where the
    mission order is based on the temperature at the time of the launch.
    *Temp* gives the temperature in Fahrenheit, *Damaged* represents the
    number of damaged O- rings, and *Undamaged* represents the number of
    O-rings that were not damaged.
    
    ```{r}
    library(openintro)
    library(tidyverse)
    library(knitr)
    library(broom)
    
    orings %>%
      slice_head(n = 12) %>%
      t() %>%
      kbl(linesep = "\\addlinespace", booktabs = TRUE, col.names = NULL)
    
    orings %>%
      slice_tail(n = 11) %>%
      t() %>%
      kbl(linesep = "\\addlinespace", booktabs = TRUE, col.names = NULL)
    
    orings %>%
      pivot_longer(cols = c(damaged, undamaged), names_to = "outcome", values_to = "n") %>%
      uncount(n) %>%
      mutate(outcome = fct_relevel(outcome, "undamaged", "damaged")) %>%
      glm(outcome ~ temperature, data = ., family = "binomial") %>%
      tidy()
    ```

    a.  Each column of the table above represents a different shuttle
        mission. Examine these data and describe what you observe with
        respect to the relationship between temperatures and damaged
        O-rings.

    b.  Failures have been coded as 1 for a damaged O-ring and 0 for an
        undamaged O-ring, and a logistic regression model was fit to
        these data. The regression output for this model is given above.
        Describe the key components of the output in words.

    c.  Write out the logistic model using the point estimates of the
        model parameters.

    d.  Based on the model, do you think concerns regarding O-rings are
        justified? Explain.

1.  **Possum classification, Part II** A logistic regression model was
    proposed for classifying common brushtail possums into their two
    regions in
    Exercise [\[possum_classification_model_select\]](#possum_classification_model_select){reference-type="ref"
    reference="possum_classification_model_select"}. The outcome
    variable took value 1 if the possum was from Victoria and 0
    otherwise.

      -------------- ---------- -------- ------- ----------------

    1.  Write out the form of the model. Also identify which of the
        variables are positively associated when controlling for other
        variables.

    2.  Suppose we see a brushtail possum at a zoo in the US, and a sign
        says the possum had been captured in the wild in Australia, but
        it doesn't say which part of Australia. However, the sign does
        indicate that the possum is male, its skull is about 63 mm wide,
        its tail is 37 cm long, and its total length is 83 cm. What is
        the reduced model's computed probability that this possum is
        from Victoria? How confident are you in the model's accuracy of
        this probability calculation?

1.  **Challenger disaster and prediction.**
    On January 28, 1986, a routine launch was anticipated for the Challenger space shuttle.
    Seventy-three seconds into the flight, disaster happened: the shuttle broke apart, killing all seven crew members on board. 
    An investigation into the cause of the disaster focused on a critical seal called an O-ring, and it is believed that damage to these O-rings during a shuttle launch may be related to the ambient temperature during the launch. 
    The investigation found that the ambient temperature at the time of the shuttle launch was closely related to the damage of O-rings, which are a critical component of the shuttle.

    1.  The data provided in the previous exercise are shown in the
        plot. The logistic model fit to these data may be written as
        $$\begin{aligned}
        \log\left( \frac{\hat{p}}{1 - \hat{p}} \right) = 11.6630 - 0.2162\times Temperature\end{aligned}$$
        where $\hat{p}$ is the model-estimated probability that an
        O-ring will become damaged. Use the model to calculate the
        probability that an O-ring will become damaged at each of the
        following ambient temperatures: 51, 53, and 55 degrees
        Fahrenheit. The model-estimated probabilities for several
        additional ambient temperatures are provided below, where
        subscripts indicate the temperature: $$\begin{aligned}
        &\hat{p}_{57} = 0.341
            && \hat{p}_{59} = 0.251
            && \hat{p}_{61} = 0.179
            && \hat{p}_{63} = 0.124 \\
        &\hat{p}_{65} = 0.084
            && \hat{p}_{67} = 0.056
            && \hat{p}_{69} = 0.037
            && \hat{p}_{71} = 0.024\end{aligned}$$

    2.  Add the model-estimated probabilities from part (a) on the plot,
        then connect these dots using a smooth curve to represent the
        model-estimated probabilities.

    3.  Describe any concerns you may have regarding applying logistic
        regression in this application, and note any assumptions that
        are required to accept the model's validity.
