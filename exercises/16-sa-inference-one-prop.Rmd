1. \(a)  False. Doesn't satisfy success-failure condition. (b) True. The success-failure condition is not satisfied. In most samples we would expect $\hat{p}$ to be close to 0.08, the true population proportion. While $\hat{p}$ can be much above 0.08, it is bound below by 0, suggesting it would take on a right skewed shape. Plotting the sampling distribution would confirm this suspicion. (c) False. $SE_{\hat{p}} = 0.0243$, and $\hat{p} = 0.12$ is only $\frac{0.12 - 0.08}{0.0243} = 1.65$ SEs away from the mean, which would not be considered unusual. (d) True. $\hat{p}=0.12$ is 2.32 standard errors away from the mean, which is often considered unusual. (e) False. Decreases the SE by a factor of $1/\sqrt{2}$.

1. \(a)  True. See the reasoning of 6.1(b). (b) True. We take the square root of the sample size in the SE formula. (c) True. The independence and success-failure conditions are satisfied. (d) True. The independence and success-failure conditions are satisfied.

1. \(a)  False. A confidence interval is constructed to estimate the population proportion, not the sample proportion. (b) True. 95% CI: $82\%\ \pm\ 2\%$. (c) True. By the definition of the confidence level. (d) True. Quadrupling the sample size decreases the SE and ME by a factor of $1/\sqrt{4}$. (e) True. The 95% CI is entirely above 50%.

1. With a random sample, independence is satisfied. The success-failure condition is also satisfied. $ME = z^{\star} \sqrt{ \frac{\hat{p} (1-\hat{p})} {n} } = 1.96 \sqrt{ \frac{0.56 \times  0.44}{600} }= 0.0397 \approx 4\%.$

1. \(a)  No. The sample only represents students who took the SAT, and this was also an online survey. (b) (0.5289, 0.5711). We are 90% confident that 53% to 57% of high school seniors who took the SAT are fairly certain that they will participate in a study abroad program in college. (c) 90% of such random samples would produce a 90% confidence interval that includes the true proportion. (d) Yes. The interval lies entirely above 50%.

1. \(a)  We want to check for a majority (or minority), so we use the following hypotheses: $H_0: p = 0.5$ and $H_A: p \neq 0.5$. We have a sample proportion of $\hat{p} = 0.55$ and a sample size of $n = 617$ independents. Since this is a random sample, independence is satisfied. The success-failure condition is also satisfied: $617 \times 0.5$ and $617 \times (1 - 0.5)$ are both at least 10 (we use the null proportion $p_0 = 0.5$ for this check in a one-proportion hypothesis test). Therefore, we can model $\hat{p}$ using a normal distribution with a standard error of $SE = \sqrt{\frac{p(1 - p)}{n}} = 0.02$. (We use the null proportion $p_0 = 0.5$ to compute the standard error for a one-proportion hypothesis test.) Next, we compute the test statistic: $Z = \frac{0.55 - 0.5}{0.02} = 2.5.$ This yields a one-tail area of 0.0062, and a p-value of $2 \times 0.0062 = 0.0124.$ Because the p-value is smaller than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. We have strong evidence that the support is different from 0.5, and since the data provide a point estimate above 0.5, we have strong evidence to support this claim by the TV pundit. (b) No. Generally we expect a hypothesis test and a confidence interval to align, so we would expect the confidence interval to show a range of plausible values entirely above 0.5. However, if the confidence level is misaligned (e.g., a 99% confidence level and a $\alpha = 0.05$ significance level), then this is no longer generally true.

1. \(a)  $H_0: p = 0.5$. $H_A: p > 0.5$. Independence (random sample, $<10\%$ of population) is satisfied, as is the success-failure conditions (using $p_0 = 0.5$, we expect 40 successes and 40 failures). $Z = 2.91$ $\to$ p- value $= 0.0018$. Since the p-value $< 0.05$, we reject the null hypothesis. The data provide strong evidence that the rate of correctly identifying a soda for these people is significantly better than just by random guessing. (b) If in fact people cannot tell the difference between diet and regular soda and they randomly guess, the probability of getting a random sample of 80 people where 53 or more identify a soda correctly would be 0.0018.
