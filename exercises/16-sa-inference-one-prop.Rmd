1. a. $SE(\hat{p})  = 0.189$. b. Roughly 0.188.  c. Yes.  d. No.  e. The parametric bootstrap is discrete (only a few distinct options) and the mathematical model is continuous (infinite options on a continuum).

1. a. $SE(\hat{p}) = 0.0126$ b. Roughly 0.0125. c. No strong reasons to choose one over the other.

1.  a. 0.7 and 0.6. b. 0.1 for both. c. Both histograms are reasonably symmetric. d. The parametric bootstrap simulation was done with $p=0.7$, and the data bootstrap simulation was done with $p=0.6$.
 

1. (a) $H_0 : p = 0.31,$  $H_A : p > 0.31.$ (b) Possibly, each student can be represented with a card. Take 100 cards, 31 black cards representing those whose ART treatment was successful and 69 red cards representing those whose treatment was not. Shuffle the cards and draw with replacement (shuffling each time in between draws) 30 cards representing the 30 patients from that clinic. Calculate the proportion of black cards in this sample, $\hat{p}_{sim},$ i.e., the proportion of those whose treatment was successful. Repeat this many times (e.g., 10,000 times) and plot the resulting sample proportions. The p-value will be the proportion of simulations where $\hat{p}_{sim} > 0.40.$ (c) There are roughly 1200 simulated proportions that are greater than 0.40. The approximate p-value is 0.12. Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject $H_0.$ The data do not provide strong evidence that the proportion of patients at the fertility clinic have a higher success rate of ART than as reported by the CDC.  (d) The large p-value leads to an inability to make a claim one way or another. With these data, we cannot make a formal conclusion.  The quote is reasonable, and it might prompt the fertility clinic to report a confidence interval for their ART success rate instead of reporting only a point estimate.
  

1. \(a)  We want to check for a majority (or minority), so we use the following hypotheses: $H_0: p = 0.5$ and $H_A: p \neq 0.5$. We have a sample proportion of $\hat{p} = 0.55$ and a sample size of $n = 617$ independents. Since this is a random sample, independence is satisfied. The success-failure condition is also satisfied: $617 \times 0.5$ and $617 \times (1 - 0.5)$ are both at least 10 (we use the null proportion $p_0 = 0.5$ for this check in a one-proportion hypothesis test). Therefore, we can model $\hat{p}$ using a normal distribution with a standard error of $SE = \sqrt{\frac{p(1 - p)}{n}} = 0.02$. (We use the null proportion $p_0 = 0.5$ to compute the standard error for a one-proportion hypothesis test.) Next, we compute the test statistic: $Z = \frac{0.55 - 0.5}{0.02} = 2.5.$ This yields a one-tail area of 0.0062, and a p-value of $2 \times 0.0062 = 0.0124.$ Because the p-value is smaller than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. We have strong evidence that the support is different from 0.5, and since the data provide a point estimate above 0.5, we have strong evidence to support this claim by the TV pundit. (b) No. Generally we expect a hypothesis test and a confidence interval to align, so we would expect the confidence interval to show a range of plausible values entirely above 0.5. However, if the confidence level is misaligned (e.g., a 99% confidence level and a $\alpha = 0.05$ significance level), then this is no longer generally true.

1.  The sampling distribution is the distribution of sample proportions
    from samples of the same size randomly sampled from the same
    population. As the same size increases, the shape of the sampling
    distribution (when $p = 0.1$) will go from being right-skewed to
    being more symmetric and resembling the normal distribution. With
    larger sample sizes, the spread of the sampling distribution gets
    smaller. Regardless of the sample size, the center of the sampling
    distribution is equal to the true mean of that population, provided
    the sampling isn't biased.

1. \(a)  True. The success-failure condition is not satisfied, there are natural boundaries at 0 and 1, and 0.77 is closer to 1, hence the distribution would probably take on a left skewed shape. Plotting the sampling distribution would confirm this suspicion. (b) False. We do not use $n \ge 30$ as a condition to check for the normality of the distribution of $\hat{p}$. (c) False. $SE_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.77 \times  0.23}{120}} = 0.0384$, and $\hat{p} = 0.85$ is only $Z = \frac{0.85 - 0.77}{0.0384} = 2.08$ standard errors away from the mean, which would be considered unusual. (d) True. $SE_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.77 \times  0.23}{120}} = 0.046$, and $\hat{p} = 0.85$ is $Z = \frac{0.85 - 0.77}{0.046} = 1.73$ standard errors away from the mean, which would not be considered unusual.

1. \(a)  True. The success-failure condition is not satisfied, there are natural boundaries at 0 and 1, and 0.25 is closer to 0, hence the distribution would probably take on a right skewed shape. Plotting the sampling distribution would confirm this suspicion. (b) True. $n = max \left( \frac{10}{0.25}, \frac{10}{0.75} \right) = min(40, 13.3) = 40$. (c) False. $SE_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.25 \times  0.75}{50}} = 0.0612$, and $\hat{p} = 0.20$ is only $Z = \frac{0.20 - 0.25}{0.0612} = -0.82$ standard errors away from the mean, which would not be considered unusual. (d) False. $SE_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.25 \times  0.75}{150}} = 0.0354$, and $\hat{p} = 0.20$ is $Z = \frac{0.20 - 0.25}{0.0354} = -1.41$ standard errors away from the mean, which would not be considered unusual. (e) False. Since $n$ appears under the square root sign in the formula for the standard error, doubling the sample size would decrease the standard error of the sample proportion only by a factor of $\sqrt{3}$.

1. \(a)  With a random sample from $<10\%$ of the population, independence is satisfied. The success-failure condition is also satisfied. $ME = 1.96 \sqrt{ \frac{0.66 \times  0.34}{1018} }= 0.029 \approx 3\%$. (b) 95% confidence interval: $0.66 \pm 0.03 = (0.63,0.69)$. Since two thirds (roughly 67%) is contained in the interval we wouldn't reject a null hypothesis where $p = 0.67$. Therefore, the data do not provide evidence that more than two thirds of the population think that drivers over the age of 65 should re-take their road test.

1. \(a)  The population parameter of interest is the proportion of all US adults who favor requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination for travel by airplane, $p$. The point estimate for this parameter is the proportion of US adults *in this sample* who favor requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination for travel by airplane, $\hat{p} = 0.57.$ (b) Since the observations are independent and the success-failure condition is met, $\hat{p}$ is expected to be approximately normal. (c) We are 95% confident that approximately 55% to 59% of all US adults who favor requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination for travel by airplane. (d) Increasing the confidence level would increase the margin of error hence widen the interval. (e) Increasing the sample size would decrease the margin of error hence make the interval narrower.

1. \(a)  60% is a sample statistic. (b)  We are 95% confident that approximately 58% to 62% of US adults think marijuana should be legalized. (c) Independence: The sample is random, and comprises less than 10% of the American population, therefore we can assume that the individuals in this sample are independent of each other. Success-failure: $1578 \times 0.61 = 962.58$ and $1578 \times 0.39 = 615.42$ are both greater than 10. Therefore the distribution of the sample proportion is expected to be approximately normal. (d) Yes, the interval is above 50%, suggesting, with 95% confidence, that the true population proportion of US adults who think marijuana should be legalized is greater than 50%.

1. (a) The independence and success-failure condition is satisfied. $H_0: p = 0.5$ and $H_A: p < 0.5$. $Z = -0.73$ and $p-value = 0.2327$. Since the p-value is large, we fail to reject $H_0$. The data do not provide strong evidence that less than half of American adults who decide not to go to college make this decision because they cannot afford college. (b) Yes, since we failed to reject $H_0: p = 0.5$.

1. \(a)  We are 90% confident that 11% to 13% of UK adults think the coronavirus will bring the world closer together. (b) The sample size $n$ should be at least 11,361.

1.  Set up hypotheses. $H_0$: $p = 0.08$, $H_A$: $p \neq 0.08$. We will
    use a significance level of $\alpha = 0.05$.\
    Simple random sample gets us independence, and the success-failure
    condition is satisfied since $21$ and $194 - 21 = 173$ are both at
    least 10.\
    $\hat{p} = 21 / 194 = 0.108$
    $SE = \sqrt{0.08 (1 - 0.08) / 194} = 0.0195$.
    $Z = \frac{0.108 - 0.08}{0.0195} = 1.44$, which has a one-tail area
    of about 0.075, so the p-value is twice this one-tail area at 0.15.\
    Because the p-value is bigger than $\alpha = 0.05$, we do not reject
    the null hypothesis. The sample does not provide convincing evidence
    that the fraction of children who are nearsighted is different from
    0.08.
