1. **Vegetarian college students.**
Suppose that 8% of college students are vegetarians. Determine if the following statements are true or false, and explain your reasoning.

    a. The distribution of the sample proportions of vegetarians in random samples of size 60 is approximately normal since $n \ge 30$.

    b. The distribution of the sample proportions of vegetarian college students in random samples of size 50 is right skewed.

    c. A random sample of 125 college students where 12% are vegetarians would be considered unusual.

    d. A random sample of 250 college students where 12% are vegetarians would be considered unusual.

    e. The standard error would be reduced by one-half if we increased the sample size from 125 to 250.

    a. The distribution of sample proportions of young Americans who think they can achieve the American dream in random samples of size 20 is left skewed.

    b. The distribution of sample proportions of young Americans who think they can achieve the American dream in random samples of size 40 is approximately normal since $n \ge 30$.

    c. A random sample of 60 young Americans where 85% think they can achieve the American dream would be considered unusual.

    d. A random sample of 120 young Americans where 85% think they can achieve the American dream would be considered unusual.

1. **Orange tabbies.** 
Suppose that 90% of orange tabby cats are male.
Determine if the following statements are true or false, and explain your reasoning.

    a. The distribution of sample proportions of random samples of size 30 is left skewed.

    b. Using a sample size that is 4 times as large will reduce the standard error of the sample proportion by one-half.

    d. The distribution of sample proportions of random samples of size 280 is approximately normal.

1. **Young Americans, Part II.**
About 25% of young Americans have delayed starting a family due to the continued economic slump.
Determine if the following statements are true or false, and explain your reasoning. [@news:youngAmericans2]

    a. The distribution of sample proportions of young Americans who have delayed starting a family due to the continued economic slump in random samples of size 12 is right skewed.

    b. In order for the distribution of sample proportions of young Americans who have delayed starting a family due to the continued economic slump to be approximately normal, we need random samples where the sample size is at least 40.

    c. A random sample of 50 young Americans where 20% have delayed starting a family due to the continued economic slump would be considered unusual.

    d. A random sample of 150 young Americans where 20% have delayed starting a family due to the continued economic slump would be considered unusual.

    e. Tripling the sample size will reduce the standard error of the sample proportion by one-third.

1. **Gender equality.**
The General Social Survey asked a random sample of 1,390 Americans the following question: "On the whole, do you think it should or should not be the government's responsibility to promote equality between men and women?" 82% of the respondents said it "should be". At a 95% confidence level, this sample has 2% margin of error. Based on this information, determine if the following statements are true or false, and explain your reasoning. [@data:gssgendereq]

    a. We are 95% confident that between 80% and 84% of Americans in this sample think it's the government's responsibility to promote equality between men and women.

    b. We are 95% confident that between 80% and 84% of all Americans think it's the government's responsibility to promote equality between men and women.

    c. If we considered many random samples of 1,390 Americans, and we calculated 95% confidence intervals for each, 95% of these intervals would include the true population proportion of Americans who think it's the government's responsibility to promote equality between men and women.

    d. In order to decrease the margin of error to 1%, we would need to quadruple (multiply by 4) the sample size.

    e. Based on this confidence interval, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that a majority of Americans think it's the government's responsibility to promote equality between men and women.

1. **Elderly drivers.** 
The Marist Poll published a report stating that 66% of adults nationally think licensed drivers should be required to retake their road test once they reach 65 years of age. It was also reported that interviews were conducted on a random sample of 1,018 American adults, and that the margin of error was 3% using a 95% confidence level. [@data:elderlyDriving]

    a. Verify the margin of error reported by The Marist Poll.

    b. Based on a 95% confidence interval, does the poll provide convincing evidence that *more than* two thirds of the population think that licensed drivers should be required to retake their road test once they turn 65?

1. **Fireworks on July 4$^{\text{th}}$.** 
A local news outlet reported that 56% of 600 randomly sampled Kansas residents planned to set off fireworks on July $4^{th}$. 
Determine the margin of error for the 56% point estimate using a 95% confidence level. [@data:july4]

1. **Proof of COVID-19 vaccination.**
A Gallup poll surveyed 3,731 randomly sampled US in April 2021, asking how they felt about requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination for travel by airplane. 
The poll found that 57% said they would favor it. [@data:gallupcovidvaccine]

    a. Describe the population parameter of interest. What is the value of the point estimate of this parameter?

    b. Check if the conditions required for constructing a confidence interval using mathematical models based on these data are met.

    c. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of US adults who favor requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination for travel by airplane.

    d. Without doing any calculations, describe what would happen to the confidence interval if we decided to use a higher confidence level.

    e. Without doing any calculations, describe what would happen to the confidence interval if we used a larger sample.

1. **Study abroad** 
A survey on 1,509 high school seniors who took the SAT and who completed an optional web survey shows that 55% of high school seniors are fairly certain that they will participate in a study abroad program in college. [@data:studyAbroad]

    a.  Is this sample a representative sample from the population of all high school seniors in the US? Explain your reasoning.

    b.  Let's suppose the conditions for inference are met. Even if your answer to part (a) indicated that this approach would not be reliable, this analysis may still be interesting to carry out (though not report). Construct a 90% confidence interval for the proportion of high school seniors (of those who took the SAT) who are fairly certain they will participate in a study abroad program in college, and interpret this interval in context.

    c.  What does "90% confidence" mean?

    d.  Based on this interval, would it be appropriate to claim that the majority of high school seniors are fairly certain that they will participate in a study abroad program in college?

1. **Legalization of marijuana.**
The General Social Survey asked a random sample of 1,563 US adults: "Do you think the use of marijuana should be made legal, or not?" 60% of the respondents said it should be made legal. [@data:gssgrass]

    a. Is 60% a sample statistic or a population parameter? Explain.

    b. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of US adults who think marijuana should be made legal, and interpret it in the context of the data.

    c. A critic points out that this 95% confidence interval is only accurate if the statistic follows a normal distribution, or if the normal model is a good approximation. Is this true for these data? Explain.

    d. A news piece on this survey's findings states, "Majority of US adults think marijuana should be legalized." Based on your confidence interval, is this news piece's statement justified?

1. **National Health Plan.** 
A *Kaiser Family Foundation* poll for a random sample of US adults in 2019 found that 79% of Democrats, 55% of Independents, and 24% of Republicans supported a generic "National Health Plan". 
There were 347 Democrats, 298 Republicans, and 617 Independents surveyed. [@data:KFF2019nathealthplan]

    a. A political pundit on TV claims that a majority of Independents support a National Health Plan. Do these data provide strong evidence to support this type of statement?

    b. Would you expect a confidence interval for the proportion of Independents who oppose the public option plan to include 0.5? Explain.

1. **Is college worth it?**
Among a simple random sample of 331 American adults who do not have a four-year college degree and are not currently enrolled in school, 48% said they decided not to go to college because they could not afford school. [@data:collegeWorthIt]

    a. A newspaper article states that only a minority of the Americans who decide not to go to college do so because they cannot afford it and uses the point estimate from this survey as evidence. Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if these data provide strong evidence supporting this statement.

    b. Would you expect a confidence interval for the proportion of American adults who decide not to go to college because they cannot afford it to include 0.5? Explain.

1. **Taste test.**
Some people claim that they can tell the difference between a diet soda and a regular soda in the first sip.
A researcher wanting to test this claim randomly sampled 80 such people.
He then filled 80 plain white cups with soda, half diet and half regular through random assignment, and asked each person to take one sip from their cup and identify the soda as diet or regular.
53 participants correctly identified the soda.

    a. Do these data provide strong evidence that these people are able to detect the difference between diet and regular soda, in other words, are the results significantly better than just random guessing?

    b. Interpret the p-value in this context.

1. **Will the coronavirus bring the world closer together?**
An April 2021 YouGov poll asked 4,265 UK adults whether they think the coronavirus bring the world closer together or leave us further apart. 
12% of the respondents said it will bring the world closer together. 37% said it would leave us further apart, 39% said it won't make a difference and the remainder didn't have an opinion on the matter. [@data:yougovcovid]

    a. Calculate, using mathematical models, a 90% confidence interval for the proportion of UK adults who think the coronavirus will bring the world closer together, and interpret the interval in context.

    b. Suppose we wanted the margin of error for the 90% confidence level to be about 0.5%. How large of a sample size would you recommend for the poll?
