1.  **Units of regression** Consider a regression predicting weight (kg)
    from height (cm) for a sample of adult males. What are the units of
    the correlation coefficient, the intercept, and the slope?

1.  Determine if I or II is higher or if they are equal. Explain your
    reasoning. For a regression line, the uncertainty associated with
    the slope estimate, $b_1$, is higher when

    1.  there is a lot of scatter around the regression line or

    2.  there is very little scatter around the regression line

1.  **Over-under, Part I** Suppose we fit a regression line to predict
    the shelf life of an apple based on its weight. For a particular
    apple, we predict the shelf life to be 4.6 days. The apple's
    residual is -0.6 days. Did we over or under estimate the shelf-life
    of the apple? Explain your reasoning.

1.  **Over-under, Part II** Suppose we fit a regression line to predict
    the number of incidents of skin cancer per 1,000 people from the
    number of sunny days in a year. For a particular year, we predict
    the incidence of skin cancer to be 1.5 per 1,000 people, and the
    residual for this year is 0.5. Did we over or under estimate the
    incidence of skin cancer? Explain your reasoning.

1.  **Tourism spending** The Association of Turkish Travel Agencies
    reports the number of foreign tourists visiting Turkey and tourist
    spending by year. [@data:turkeyTourism] Three plots are provided:
    scatterplot showing the relationship between these two variables
    along with the least squares fit, residuals plot, and histogram of
    residuals.

    ![](03/exercises/figures/tourism_spending_count_residuals.png){width="32%"}
    ![](03/exercises/figures/tourism_spending_count_residuals_hist.png){width="32%"}

    1.  Describe the relationship between number of tourists and
        spending.

    2.  What are the explanatory and response variables?

    3.  Why might we want to fit a regression line to these data?

    4.  Do the data meet the conditions required for fitting a least
        squares line? In addition to the scatterplot, use the residual
        plot and histogram to answer this question.

1.  **Nutrition at Starbucks, Part I** The scatterplot below shows the
    relationship between the number of calories and amount of
    carbohydrates (in grams) Starbucks food menu items contain.
    [@data:starbucksCals] Since Starbucks only lists the number of
    calories on the display items, we are interested in predicting the
    amount of carbs a menu item has based on its calorie content.

    1.  Describe the relationship between number of calories and amount
        of carbohydrates (in grams) that Starbucks food menu items
        contain.

    2.  In this scenario, what are the explanatory and response
        variables?

    3.  Why might we want to fit a regression line to these data?

    4.  Do these data meet the conditions required for fitting a least
        squares line?

1.  **The Coast Starlight, Part II**
    Exercise [\[coast_starlight_corr_units\]](#coast_starlight_corr_units){reference-type="ref"
    reference="coast_starlight_corr_units"} introduces data on the Coast
    Starlight Amtrak train that runs from Seattle to Los Angeles. The
    mean travel time from one stop to the next on the Coast Starlight is
    129 mins, with a standard deviation of 113 minutes. The mean
    distance traveled from one stop to the next is 108 miles with a
    standard deviation of 99 miles. The correlation between travel time
    and distance is 0.636.

    1.  Write the equation of the regression line for predicting travel
        time.

    2.  Interpret the slope and the intercept in this context.

    3.  Calculate $R^2$ of the regression line for predicting travel
        time from distance traveled for the Coast Starlight, and
        interpret $R^2$ in the context of the application.

    4.  The distance between Santa Barbara and Los Angeles is 103 miles.
        Use the model to estimate the time it takes for the Starlight to
        travel between these two cities.

    5.  It actually takes the Coast Starlight about 168 mins to travel
        from Santa Barbara to Los Angeles. Calculate the residual and
        explain the meaning of this residual value.

    6.  Suppose Amtrak is considering adding a stop to the Coast
        Starlight 500 miles away from Los Angeles. Would it be
        appropriate to use this linear model to predict the travel time
        from Los Angeles to this point?

1.  **Body measurements, Part III**
    Exercise [\[body_measurements_shoulder_height_corr_units\]](#body_measurements_shoulder_height_corr_units){reference-type="ref"
    reference="body_measurements_shoulder_height_corr_units"} introduces
    data on shoulder girth and height of a group of individuals. The
    mean shoulder girth is 107.20 cm with a standard deviation of
    10.37 cm. The mean height is 171.14 cm with a standard deviation of
    9.41 cm. The correlation between height and shoulder girth is 0.67.

    1.  Write the equation of the regression line for predicting height.

    2.  Interpret the slope and the intercept in this context.

    3.  Calculate $R^2$ of the regression line for predicting height
        from shoulder girth, and interpret it in the context of the
        application.

        of 100 cm. Predict the height of this student using the model.

    5.  The student from part (d) is 160 cm tall. Calculate the
        residual, and explain what this residual means.

    6.  A one year old has a shoulder girth of 56 cm. Would it be
        appropriate to use this linear model to predict the height of
        this child?
