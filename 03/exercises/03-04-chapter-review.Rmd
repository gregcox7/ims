1.  **True / False** Determine if the following statements are true or
    false. If false, explain why.

    1.  A correlation coefficient of -0.90 indicates a stronger linear
        relationship than a correlation of 0.5.

    2.  Correlation is a measure of the association between any two
        variables.

1.  **Trees** The scatterplots below show the relationship between
    height, diameter, and volume of timber in 31 felled black cherry
    trees. The diameter of the tree is measured 4.5 feet above the
    ground. [@data:trees]

    ![](03/exercises/figures/trees_volume_height.png){width="46%"}
    ![](03/exercises/figures/trees_volume_diameter.png){width="46%"}

    1.  Describe the relationship between volume and height of these
        trees.

    2.  Describe the relationship between volume and diameter of these
        trees.

    3.  Suppose you have height and diameter measurements for another
        black cherry tree. Which of these variables would be preferable
        to use to predict the volume of timber in this tree using a
        simple linear regression model? Explain your reasoning.

1.  **Husbands and wives, Part III**
    Exercise [\[husbands_wives_height_inf\]](#husbands_wives_height_inf){reference-type="ref"
    reference="husbands_wives_height_inf"} presents a scatterplot
    displaying the relationship between husbands' and wives' ages in a
    random sample of 170 married couples in Britain, where both
    partners' ages are below 65 years. Given below is summary output of
    the least squares fit for predicting wife's age from husband's age.

    ![](03/exercises/figures/husbands_wives_age.png){width="\\textwidth"}

                      Estimate   Std. Error   t value   Pr($>$$|$t$|$)
      ------------- ---------- ------------ --------- ----------------
        (Intercept)     1.5740       1.1501      1.37           0.1730
        age_husband     0.9112       0.0259     35.25           0.0000
         $df = 168$                                   

    1.  We might wonder, is the age difference between husbands and
        wives consistent across ages? If this were the case, then the
        slope parameter would be $\beta_1 = 1$. Use the information
        above to evaluate if there is strong evidence that the
        difference in husband and wife ages differs for different ages.

    2.  Write the equation of the regression line for predicting wife's
        age from husband's age.

    3.  Interpret the slope and intercept in context.

    4.  Given that $R^2 = 0.88$, what is the correlation of ages in this
        data set?

    5.  You meet a married man from Britain who is 55 years old. What
        would you predict his wife's age to be? How reliable is this
        prediction?

    6.  You meet another married man from Britain who is 85 years old.
        Would it be wise to use the same linear model to predict his
        wife's age? Explain.

1.  **Cats, Part II**
    Exercise [\[cat_body_heart_reg\]](#cat_body_heart_reg){reference-type="ref"
    reference="cat_body_heart_reg"} presents regression output from a
    model for predicting the heart weight (in g) of cats from their body
    weight (in kg). The coefficients are estimated using a dataset of
    144 domestic cat. The model output is also provided below.

                      Estimate   Std. Error   t value   Pr($>$$|$t$|$)
      ------------- ---------- ------------ --------- ----------------
        (Intercept)     -0.357        0.692    -0.515            0.607
            body wt      4.034        0.250    16.119            0.000

    $$s = 1.452 \qquad R^2 = 64.66\% \qquad R^2_{adj} = 64.41\%$$

    1.  We see that the point estimate for the slope is positive. What
        are the hypotheses for evaluating whether body weight is
        positively associated with heart weight in cats?

    2.  State the conclusion of the hypothesis test from part (a) in
        context of the data.

    3.  Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the slope of body
        weight, and interpret it in context of the data.

    4.  Do your results from the hypothesis test and the confidence
        interval agree? Explain.

1.  **Nutrition at Starbucks, Part II**
    Exercise [\[starbucks_cals_carbos\]](#starbucks_cals_carbos){reference-type="ref"
    reference="starbucks_cals_carbos"} introduced a data set on
    nutrition information on Starbucks food menu items. Based on the
    scatterplot and the residual plot provided, describe the
    relationship between the protein content and calories of these menu
    items, and determine if a simple linear model is appropriate to
    predict amount of protein from the number of calories.

1.  **Helmets and lunches** The scatterplot shows the relationship
    between socioeconomic status measured as the percentage of children
    in a neighborhood receiving reduced-fee lunches at school (`lunch`)
    and the percentage of bike riders in the neighborhood wearing
    helmets (`helmet`). The average percentage of children receiving
    reduced-fee lunches is 30.8% with a standard deviation of 26.7% and
    the average percentage of bike riders wearing helmets is 38.8% with
    a standard deviation of 16.9%.

    1.  If the $R^2$ for the least-squares regression line for these
        data is $72\%$, what is the correlation between `lunch` and
        `helmet`?

    2.  Calculate the slope and intercept for the least-squares
        regression line for these data.

    3.  Interpret the intercept of the least-squares regression line in
        the context of the application.

    4.  Interpret the slope of the least-squares regression line in the
        context of the application.

    5.  What would the value of the residual be for a neighborhood where
        40% of the children receive reduced-fee lunches and 40% of the
        bike riders wear helmets? Interpret the meaning of this residual
        in the context of the application.

1.  **Match the correlation, Part III** Match each correlation to the
    corresponding scatterplot.

    1.  $r = -0.72$

1.  **Rate my professor** Many college courses conclude by giving
    students the opportunity to evaluate the course and the instructor
    anonymously. However, the use of these student evaluations as an
    indicator of course quality and teaching effectiveness is often
    criticized because these measures may reflect the influence of
    non-teaching related characteristics, such as the physical
    appearance of the instructor. Researchers at University of Texas,
    Austin collected data on teaching evaluation score (higher score
    means better) and standardized beauty score (a score of 0 means
    average, negative score means below average, and a positive score
    means above average) for a sample of 463 professors.
    [@Hamermesh:2005] The scatterplot below shows the relationship
    between these variables, and regression output is provided for
    predicting teaching evaluation score from beauty score.

                      Estimate   Std. Error   t value   Pr($>$$|$t$|$)
      ------------- ---------- ------------ --------- ----------------
        (Intercept)      4.010       0.0255    157.21           0.0000
             beauty                  0.0322      4.13           0.0000

    1.  Given that the average standardized beauty score is -0.0883 and
        average teaching evaluation score is 3.9983, calculate the
        slope. Alternatively, the slope may be computed using just the
        information provided in the model summary table.

    2.  Do these data provide convincing evidence that the slope of the
        relationship between teaching evaluation and beauty is positive?
        Explain your reasoning.

    3.  List the conditions required for linear regression and check if
        each one is satisfied for this model based on the following
        diagnostic plots.
