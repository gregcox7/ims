1.  **Outliers, Part I** Identify the outliers in the scatterplots shown
    below, and determine what type of outliers they are. Explain your
    reasoning.

1.  **Urban homeowners, Part I** The scatterplot below shows the percent
    of families who own their home vs. the percent of the population
    living in urban areas. [@data:urbanOwner] There are 52 observations,
    each corresponding to a state in the US. Puerto Rico and District of
    Columbia are also included.

    1.  Describe the relationship between the percent of families who
        own their home and the percent of the population living in urban
        areas.

    2.  The outlier at the bottom right corner is District of Columbia,
        where 100% of the population is considered urban. What type of
        an outlier is this observation?

1.  **Crawling babies, Part II**
    ExerciseÂ [\[crawling_babies_corr_units\]](#crawling_babies_corr_units){reference-type="ref"
    reference="crawling_babies_corr_units"} introduces data on the
    average monthly temperature during the month babies first try to
    crawl (about 6 months after birth) and the average first crawling
    age for babies born in a given month. A scatterplot of these two
    variables reveals a potential outlying month when the average
    temperature is about 53F and average crawling age is about 28.5
    weeks. Does this point have high leverage? Is it an influential
    point?
