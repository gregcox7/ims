1.  **Visualize the residuals** The scatterplots shown below each have a
    superimposed regression line. If we were to construct a residual
    plot (residuals versus $x$) for each, describe what those plots
    would look like.

1.  **Trends in the residuals** Shown below are two plots of residuals
    remaining after fitting a linear model to two different sets of
    data. Describe important features and determine if a linear model
    would be appropriate for these data. Explain your reasoning.

1.  **Identify relationships, Part I** For each of the six plots,
    identify the strength of the relationship (e.g. weak, moderate, or
    strong) in the data and whether fitting a linear model would be
    reasonable.

1.  **Exams and grades** The two scatterplots below show the
    relationship between final and mid-semester exam grades recorded
    during several years for a Statistics course at a university.

    1.  Based on these graphs, which of the two exams has the strongest
        correlation with the final exam grade? Explain.

    2.  Can you think of a reason why the correlation between the exam
        you chose in part (a) and the final exam is higher?

1.  **Husbands and wives, Part I.** 
The Great Britain Office of Population Census and Surveys once collected data on a random sample of 170 married couples in Britain, recording the age (in years) and heights (converted here to inches) of the husbands and wives. [@Hand:1994] The scatterplot on the left shows the wife's age plotted against her husband's age, and the plot on the right shows wife's height plotted against husband's height.

    ![](03/exercises/figures/husbands_wives_age.png){width="38%"}
    ![](03/exercises/figures/husbands_wives_height.png){width="38%"}

    1.  Describe the relationship between husbands' and wives' ages.

    2.  Describe the relationship between husbands' and wives' heights.

    3.  Which plot shows a stronger correlation? Explain your reasoning.

    4.  Data on heights were originally collected in centimeters, and
        then converted to inches. Does this conversion affect the
        correlation between husbands' and wives' heights?

1.  **Match the correlation, Part I** Match each correlation to the
    corresponding scatterplot.

    1.  $r = -0.7$

    2.  $r = 0.45$

    3.  $r = 0.06$

    4.  $r = 0.92$

    3.  $r = -0.03$

1.  **Speed and height** 1,302 UCLA students were asked to fill out a
    survey where they were asked about their height, fastest speed they
    have ever driven, and gender. The scatterplot on the left displays
    the relationship between height and fastest speed, and the
    scatterplot on the right displays the breakdown by gender in this
    relationship.

    ![](03/exercises/figures/speed_height.png){width="48.5%"}
    ![](03/exercises/figures/speed_height_gender.png){width="48.5%"}

    1.  Describe the relationship between height and fastest speed.

    2.  Why do you think these variables are positively associated?

    3.  What role does gender play in the relationship between height
        and fastest driving speed?

1.  **Guess the correlation** Eduardo and Rosie are both collecting data
    on number of rainy days in a year and the total rainfall for the
    year. Eduardo records rainfall in inches and Rosie in centimeters.
    How will their correlation coefficients compare?

1.  **The Coast Starlight, Part I** The Coast Starlight Amtrak train
    runs from Seattle to Los Angeles. The scatterplot below displays the
    distance between each stop (in miles) and the amount of time it
    takes to travel from one stop to another (in minutes).

    1.  Describe the relationship between distance and travel time.

    2.  How would the relationship change if travel time was instead
        measured in hours, and distance was instead measured in
        kilometers?

    3.  Correlation between travel time (in miles) and distance (in
        minutes) is $r = 0.636$. What is the correlation between travel
        time (in kilometers) and distance (in hours)?

1.  **Crawling babies, Part I** A study conducted at the University of
    Denver investigated whether babies take longer to learn to crawl in
    cold months, when they are often bundled in clothes that restrict
    their movement, than in warmer months. [@Benson:1993] Infants born
    during the study year were split into twelve groups, one for each
    birth month. We consider the average crawling age of babies in each
    group against the average temperature when the babies are six months
    old (that's when babies often begin trying to crawl). Temperature is
    measured in degrees Fahrenheit (F) and age is measured in weeks.

    1.  Describe the relationship between temperature and crawling age.

    2.  How would the relationship change if temperature was measured in
        degrees Celsius (C) and age was measured in months?

    3.  The correlation between temperature in F and age in weeks was
        $r=-0.70$. If we converted the temperature to C and age to
        months, what would the correlation be?

1.  **Body measurements, Part I** Researchers studying anthropometry
    collected body girth measurements and skeletal diameter
    measurements, as well as age, weight, height and gender for 507
    physically active individuals. [@Heinz:2003] The scatterplot below
    shows the relationship between height and shoulder girth (over
    deltoid muscles), both measured in centimeters.

    1.  Describe the relationship between shoulder girth and height.

    2.  How would the relationship change if shoulder girth was measured
        in inches while the units of height remained in centimeters?

    relationship between weight measured in kilograms and hip girth
    measured in centimeters from the data described in
    ExerciseÂ [\[body_measurements_shoulder_height_corr_units\]](#body_measurements_shoulder_height_corr_units){reference-type="ref"
    reference="body_measurements_shoulder_height_corr_units"}.
