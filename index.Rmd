# Welcome {-}

<!--
This book may be downloaded as a free PDF at [openintro.org](http://www.openintro.org).

We hope readers will take away three ideas from this book in addition to forming a foundation of statistical thinking and methods.

1. Statistics is an applied field with a wide range of practical applications.
2. You don't have to be a math guru to learn from interesting, real data.
3. Data are messy, and statistical tools are imperfect. However, when you understand the strengths and weaknesses of these tools, you can use them to learn interesting things about the~world.

```{block2, type="rmdimportant", echo=TRUE}
This book is currently in active development, and is planned for launch in late 2020 as the 2nd edition of OpenIntro Statistics - Introduction to Statistics with Randomization and Simulation. The 1st edition of the book can be accessed at [openintro.org/book/isrs](https://www.openintro.org/book/isrs/).
```

## Textbook overview {-}

1. **Introduction to data.** Data structures, variables, summaries, graphics, and basic data collection techniques.
2. **Exploratory data analysis.** Data visualization and summarisation.
3. **Correlation and regression.** Visualising relationships between many variables and descriptive summaries for quantifying the relationship between two variables.
4. **Multiple regression.** Descriptive summaries for quantifying the relationship between two variables.
5. **Foundations for inference.** Case studies are used to introduce the ideas of statistical inference with randomization and simulations. 
6. **Inference for categorical data.** Inference for proportions using simulation and randomization techniques as well as the normal and chi-square distributions.
7. **Inference for numerical data.** Inference for one or two sample means using simulation and randomization techniques as well as the normal and F distributions.
8. **Inference for regression.** Extending inference techniques presented thus-far to regression settings.
7. **Appendix: Probability.** An introduction to probability is provided as an optional reference. Exercises and additional probability content may be found in Chapter 3 of OpenIntro Statistics at [openintro.org/book/os](https://www.openintro.org/book/os/).

## Examples and exercises {-}

```{block2, type="todo", echo=TRUE}
Update when design is for these is closer to being finalised.
```

Examples are provided to establish an understanding of how to apply methods.

```{block2, type="example", echo=TRUE}
This is an example. When a question is asked here, where can the answer be found?
  
---

The answer can be found here, in the solution section of the example!
```

When we think the reader should be ready to try determining the solution to an example, we frame it as Guided Practice.

```{block2, type="guidedpractice", echo=TRUE}
The reader may check or learn the answer to any Guided Practice problem by reviewing the full solution in a footnote.^[Guided Practice problems are intended to stretch your thinking, and you can check yourself by reviewing the footnote solution for any Guided Practice.]
```

Exercises are also provided at the end of each section as well as review exercises at the end of each chapter. Solutions are given for odd-numbered exercises in Appendix A.

## OpenIntro, online resources, and getting involved {-}

```{block2, type="todo", echo=TRUE}
This should be revisited as well, probably needs to line up with OS4.
```

OpenIntro is an organization focused on developing free and affordable education materials.

We encourage anyone learning or teaching statistics to visit [openintro.org] (http://www.openintro.org) and get involved. We also provide many free online resources, including free course software. Students can test their knowledge with practice quizzes for each chapter or try an application of concepts learned using real data. 

Data sets for this textbook are available on the website and through a companion R package, [**openintro**](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro-r-package/).^[Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, David Diez, Andrew Bray, Albert Kim, Ben Baumer, Chester Ismay and Christopher Barr (2020). openintro: Data Sets and Supplemental Functions from 'OpenIntro' Textbooks and Labs. R package version 2.0.0. https://github.com/OpenIntroStat/openintro.] All of these resources are free, and we want to be clear that anyone is welcome to use these online tools and resources with or without this textbook as a companion.

We value your feedback. If there is a part of the project you especially like or think needs improvement, we want to hear from you. You may find our contact form at [openintro.org](https://www.openintro.org/form/?f=contact).

## Acknowledgements {-}

```{block2, type="todo", echo=TRUE}
