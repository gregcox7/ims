1.  **Side effects of Avandia** Rosiglitazone is the active ingredient
    in the controversial typeÂ 2 diabetes medicine Avandia and has been
    linked to an increased risk of serious cardiovascular problems such
    as stroke, heart failure, and death. A common alternative treatment
    is pioglitazone, the active ingredient in a diabetes medicine called
    Actos. In a nationwide retrospective observational study of 227,571
    Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years or older, it was found that
    2,593 of the 67,593 patients using rosiglitazone and 5,386 of the
    159,978 using pioglitazone had serious cardiovascular problems.
    These data are summarized in the contingency table below.

    1.  Determine if each of the following statements is true or false.
        If false, explain why. *Be careful:* The reasoning may be wrong
        even if the statement's conclusion is correct. In such cases,
        the statement should be considered false.

    2.  What proportion of all patients had cardiovascular problems?

    3.  If the type of treatment and having cardiovascular problems were
        independent, about how many patients in the rosiglitazone group
        would we expect to have had cardiovascular problems?

    4.  We can investigate the relationship between outcome and
        treatment in this study using a randomization technique. While
        in reality we would carry out the simulations required for
        randomization using statistical software, suppose we actually
        simulate using index cards. In order to simulate from the
        independence model, which states that the outcomes were
        independent of the treatment, we write whether or not each
        patient had a cardiovascular problem on cards, shuffled all the
        cards together, then deal them into two groups of size 67,593
        and 159,978. We repeat this simulation 1,000 times and each time
        record the number of people in the rosiglitazone group who had
        cardiovascular problems. Use the relative frequency histogram of
        these counts to answer (i)-(iii).

1.  **Heart transplants** The Stanford University Heart Transplant Study
    was conducted to determine whether an experimental heart transplant
    program increased lifespan. Each patient entering the program was
    designated an official heart transplant candidate, meaning that he
    was gravely ill and would most likely benefit from a new heart. Some
    patients got a transplant and some did not. The variable
    `transplant` indicates which group the patients were in; patients in
    the treatment group got a transplant and those in the control group
    did not. Of the 34 patients in the control group, 30 died. Of the 69
    people in the treatment group, 45 died. Another variable called
    `survived` was used to indicate whether or not the patient was alive
    at the end of the study. [@Turnbull+Brown+Hu:1974]

    1.  Based on the mosaic plot, is survival independent of whether or
        not the patient got a transplant? Explain your reasoning.

    2.  What do the box plots below suggest about the efficacy
        (effectiveness) of the heart transplant treatment.

    3.  What proportion of patients in the treatment group and what
        proportion of patients in the control group died?

    4.  One approach for investigating whether or not the treatment is
        effective is to use a randomization technique.
