1.  **Exam scores** The average on a history exam (scored out of 100
    points) was 85, with a standard deviation of 15. Is the distribution
    of the scores on this exam symmetric? If not, what shape would you
    expect this distribution to have? Explain your reasoning.

1.  **Infant mortality** The infant mortality rate is defined as the
    number of infant deaths per 1,000 live births. This rate is often
    used as an indicator of the level of health in a country. The
    relative frequency histogram below shows the distribution of
    estimated infant death rates for 224 countries for which such data
    were available in 2014. The data for this exercise can be found in the openintro package: `cia_factbook`.

    1.  Estimate Q1, the median, and Q3 from the histogram.

    2.  Would you expect the mean of this data set to be smaller or
        larger than the median? Explain your reasoning.

1.  **Make-up exam** In a class of 25 students, 24 of them took an exam
    in class and 1 student took a make-up exam the following day. The
    professor graded the first batch of 24 exams and found an average
    score of 74 points with a standard deviation of 8.9 points. The
    student who took the make-up the following day scored 64 points on
    the exam.

    1.  Does the new student's score increase or decrease the average
        score?

    2.  What is the new average?

    3.  Does the new student's score increase or decrease the standard
        deviation of the scores?

1.  **Marathon winners** The histogram and box plots below show the
    distribution of finishing times for male and female winners of the
    New York Marathon between 1970 and 1999.

    1.  What features of the distribution are apparent in the histogram
        and not the box plot? What features are apparent in the box plot
        but not in the histogram?

    2.  What may be the reason for the bimodal distribution? Explain.

    3.  Compare the distribution of marathon times for men and women
        based on the box plot shown below.

    4.  The time series plot shown below is another way to look at these
        data. Describe what is visible in this plot but not in the
        others.

1.  **A new statistic** The statistic $\frac{\bar{x}}{median}$ can be
    used as a measure of skewness. Suppose we have a distribution where
    all observations are greater than 0, $x_i > 0$. What is the expected
    shape of the distribution under the following conditions? Explain
    your reasoning.

    1.  $\frac{\bar{x}}{median} = 1$

    2.  $\frac{\bar{x}}{median} < 1$

    3.  $\frac{\bar{x}}{median} > 1$

1.  **Oscar winners** The first Oscar awards for best actor and best
    actress were given out in 1929. The histograms below show the age
    distribution for all of the best actor and best actress winners from
    1929 to 2018. Summary statistics for these distributions are also
    provided. Compare the distributions of ages of best actor and
    actress winners. [@data:oscars]\

              Best Actress

      Mean        36.2

1.  **Stats scores** Below are the final exam scores of twenty
    introductory statistics students.

    57, 66, 69, 71, 72, 73, 74, 77, 78, 78, 79, 79, 81, 81, 82, 83, 83,
    88, 89, 94

    Create a box plot of the distribution of these scores. The five
    number summary provided below may be useful.

       Min    Q1    Q2 (Median)    Q3    Max
      ----- ------ ------------- ------ -----
       57    72.5      78.5       82.5   94
