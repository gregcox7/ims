1.  **Air quality** Daily air quality is measured by the air quality
    index (AQI) reported by the Environmental Protection Agency. This
    index reports the pollution level and what associated health effects
    might be a concern. The index is calculated for five major air
    pollutants regulated by the Clean Air Act and takes values from 0 to
    300, where a higher value indicates lower air quality. AQI was
    reported for a sample of 91 days in 2011 in Durham, NC. The relative
    frequency histogram below shows the distribution of the AQI values
    on these days. [@data:durhamAQI:2011]\

    1.  Estimate the median AQI value of this sample.

    2.  Would you expect the mean AQI value of this sample to be higher
        or lower than the median? Explain your reasoning.

    3.  Estimate Q1, Q3, and IQR for the distribution.

    4.  Would any of the days in this sample be considered to have an
        unusually low or high AQI? Explain your reasoning.

1.  **Associations** Indicate which of the plots show (a) a positive
    association, (b) a negative association, or (c) no association. Also
    determine if the positive and negative associations are linear or
    nonlinear. Each part may refer to more than one plot.

1.  **Sleeping in college** A recent article in a college newspaper
    stated that college students get an average of 5.5 hrs of sleep each
    night. A student who was skeptical about this value decided to
    conduct a survey by randomly sampling 25 students. On average, the
    sampled students slept 6.25 hours per night. Identify which value
    represents the sample mean and which value represents the claimed
    population mean.

1.  **Commute times** The US census collects data on time it takes
    Americans to commute to work, among many other variables. The
    histogram below shows the distribution of average commute times in
    3,142 US counties in 2010. Also shown below is a spatial intensity
    map of the same data.

    1.  Describe the numerical distribution and comment on whether or
        not a log transformation may be advisable for these data.

    2.  Describe the spatial distribution of commuting times using the
        map below.

1.  **Hispanic population** The US census collects data on race and
    ethnicity of Americans, among many other variables. The histogram
    below shows the distribution of the percentage of the population
    that is Hispanic in 3,142 counties in the US in 2010. Also shown is
    a histogram of logs of these values.

    1.  Describe the numerical distribution and comment on why we might
        want to use log-transformed values in analyzing or modeling
        these data.

    2.  What features of the distribution of the Hispanic population in
        US counties are apparent in the map but not in the histogram?
        What features are apparent in the histogram but not the map?

    3.  Is one visualization more appropriate or helpful than the other?
        Explain your reasoning.

1.  **Days off at a mining plant** Workers at a particular mining site
    receive an average of 35 days paid vacation, which is lower than the
    national average. The manager of this plant is under pressure from a
    local union to increase the amount of paid time off. However, he
    does not want to give more days off to the workers because that
    would be costly. Instead he decides he should fire 10 employees in
    such a way as to raise the average number of days off that are
    reported by his employees. In order to achieve this goal, should he
    fire employees who have the most number of days off, least number of
    days off, or those who have about the average number of days off?

1.  **Facebook friends** Facebook data indicate that 50% of Facebook
    users have 100 or more friends, and that the average friend count of
    users is 190. What do these findings suggest about the shape of the
    distribution of number of friends of Facebook users?

1.  **Distributions and appropriate statistics, Part II** For each of
    the following, state whether you expect the distribution to be
    symmetric, right skewed, or left skewed. Also specify whether the
    mean or median would best represent a typical observation in the
    data, and whether the variability of observations would be best
    represented using the standard deviation or IQR. Explain your
    reasoning.

        \$350,000, 50% of the houses cost below \$450,000, 75% of the
        houses cost below \$1,000,000 and there are a meaningful number
        of houses that cost more than \$6,000,000.

    distribution of the yearly incomes of 40 patrons at a college coffee
    shop. Suppose two new people walk into the coffee shop: one making
    \$225,000 and the other \$250,000. The second histogram shows the

    1.  Would the mean or the median best represent what we might think
        of as a typical income for the 42 patrons at this coffee shop?
        What does this say about the robustness of the two measures?

    2.  Would the standard deviation or the IQR best represent the
        amount of variability in the incomes of the 42 patrons at this
        coffee shop? What does this say about the robustness of the two
        measures?

    and gestation lengths (in days) for 62 mammals. A scatterplot of
    life span versus length of gestation is shown below.
    [@Allison+Cicchetti:1975]

    1.  What type of an association is apparent between life span and
        length of gestation?

    2.  What type of an association would you expect to see if the axes
        of the plot were reversed, i.e. if we plotted length of

1.  **Midrange** The *midrange* of a distribution is defined as the
    average of the maximum and the minimum of that distribution. Is this
    statistic robust to outliers and extreme skew? Explain your
    reasoning

1.  **Office productivity** Office productivity is relatively low when
    the employees feel no stress about their work or job security.
    However, high levels of stress can also lead to reduced employee
    productivity. Sketch a plot to represent the relationship between
    stress and productivity.

1.  **Parameters and statistics** Identify which value represents the
    sample mean and which value represents the claimed population mean.

    1.  American households spent an average of about \$52 in 2007 on
        Halloween merchandise such as costumes, decorations and candy.
        To see if this number had changed, researchers conducted a new
        survey in 2008 before industry numbers were reported. The survey
        included 1,500 households and found that average Halloween
        spending was \$58 per household.

    2.  The average GPA of students in 2001 at a private university was
        3.37. A survey on a sample of 203 students from this university
        yielded an average GPA of 3.59 a decade later.

1.  **Reproducing bacteria** Suppose that there is only sufficient space
    and nutrients to support one million bacterial cells in a petri
    dish. You place a few bacterial cells in this petri dish, allow them
    to reproduce freely, and record the number of bacterial cells in the
    dish over time. Sketch a plot representing the relationship between
    number of bacterial cells and time.
