::: {.chapterintro}
The principles of simple linear regression lay the foundation for more sophisticated regression models used in a wide range of challenging settings. 
In this chapter, we explore multiple regression, which introduces the possibility of more than one predictor in a linear model, and logistic regression, a technique for predicting categorical outcomes with two levels.

## Chapter review {#chp4-review}

### Terms

We introduced the following terms in the chapter. 
If you're not sure what some of these terms mean, we recommend you go back in the text and review their definitions.
We are purposefully presenting them in alphabetical order, instead of in order of appearance, so they will be a little more challenging to locate. 
However you should be able to easily spot them as **bolded text**.
